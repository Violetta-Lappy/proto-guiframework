Prototype gui framework library

You know, you could just use Dear Imgui or RmlUi before doing this reinventing madness

... it's not enough

Fair enough

Gui Framework support for:
- Immediate Mode UI
- Retained UI (HTML / HTMX Render - CSS - JavaScript)

Target towards graphic api:
- OpenGL
- Vulkan
- WebGPU
